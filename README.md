Fibonacci Generator Project

The Fibonacci Generator is a program designed to compute numbers in the Fibonacci sequence efficiently. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. This sequence has wide applications in mathematics, computer science, and natural patterns.

Key Features:

Dynamic Generation: Supports generating Fibonacci numbers up to a user-defined limit or position.
Memory Optimization: Utilizes efficient algorithms to reduce memory usage for large sequences.
Interactive Interface: Includes options for user input to customize output, such as nth term generation or sequence range.
Real-Time Performance: Implements an iterative or generator-based approach for fast and scalable computation.
Applications:

Algorithm and data structure analysis.
Modeling real-world phenomena, such as population growth and branching structures.
Educational tool for understanding recursion and iterative processes.
This project offers a practical and engaging way to explore the Fibonacci sequence while demonstrating concepts like recursion, iteration, and efficiency in algorithm design.
